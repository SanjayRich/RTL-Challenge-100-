# RTL Challenge 

This repository contains my daily RTL design practice as part of a self-driven RTL challenge.
Each day focuses on designing, simulating, and verifying a core digital block using Verilog.

##  Day-wise Progress

- **[DAY 1 – Priority Encoder](./DAY_1)**
- **[DAY 2 – BCD TO 7 SEG DISPLAY](./DAY_2)**

## Goal
To strengthen RTL design, verification skills, and build a strong hardware design portfolio for VLSI roles.
